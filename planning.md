hangman rules from online:
	Place one dash on the bottom of the game board for each letter of the word or words
	chosen. Leave a space between words.
	If the word is dog, draw three spaces, like this: __ __ __.
	Have the other player guess one letter at a time - or he or she can use a turn to guess the
	entire word or words.
	Fill in the letter everywhere it appears on the appropriate dash (or dashes) each time the
	person guesses correctly. Circle the letter on the alphabet if is guessed correctly. Add one
	body part to the drawing each time the letter chosen is not in the word. Begin by drawing a
	head attached to the short vertical line (the "noose"). Add eyes, ears, nose, hair, body, legs,
	and arms. Put an X through the letter that was guessed and not correct. You may also wish
	to make your drawings very elaborate - one ear at a time, a neck, and a belly button - so that
	children will have a lot of guesses before losing.
	If the drawing of the person is completed before the word or words are guessed, the
	guessing player loses. If the player figures out the word or words first, he or she wins.
